In this thesis, the interaction of cells with a bio-functionalized surface under laminar flow conditions will be simulated from a hydrodynamic and magnetic point of view. Then, a reference system for the variation of surface receptor density will be established and subsequently evaluated. Ultimately, an affinity-based concentration assay will be presented which reveals promising results for the magnetic measurement of biomarker concentrations or single cell surface proteins in the future.
