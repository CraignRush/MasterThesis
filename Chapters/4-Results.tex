\section{Virtual Prototyping of Cell Signals}
\label{sec:res:simMag}
During the course of this thesis, numerical simulations for the microchannel have been carried out in MATLAB. First, a simulation about the shape of a \gls{gmr}-sensor signal of cells was performed, where the magnetic moment was conveyed through \glspl{mnp} bound to their surface. Second, cell aggregates have been looked at in the same manner with different angles respective to the sensor. Third, both simulations were correlated to a reference dipole, with the equivalent magnetic momentum located in the center of mass.\\
Additionally, the flow and shear field inside the channel was simulated numerically for the channel cross-section as well as for a particle near the walls. A force equilibrium simulation was also established in a basic manner. \\
All simulations have been captured inside the MATLAB class ``MRCyte'', which contains material parameters, constants and the necessary functions for all simulations above.
\subsection{Numerical investigation of immunomagnetic label density and size on quantitative magnetoresistive sensing of single cells and cell aggregates}
In order to mimic a immunomagnetically labeled cell flowing over the sensor half bridge, the planar integral of the respective \acrfull{B} was solved analytically. Here, $\mathbf{r}_i$ specifies the distance vector of a single \gls{mnp} from the sensor plane. The magnetic flux density was converted to a resistive change $\mathbf{R}_\text{sig}$ by scaling it with the \gls{gmr}-sensitivity $S$ and subsequently into a signal voltage $\mathbf{V}_\text{sig}$ inside the bridge branch.(\cref{eq:magneticFluxIntegral,eq:GMR-signal,eq:voltage-signal})\\
First, \glspl{mnp} were randomly sampled on a sphere surface with an diameter of \SI{4}{\micro\meter} or \SI{8}{\micro\meter}. Then, the signal was computed from the superposition of every \gls{mnp} during each timestep. Additionally, the \gls{mnp} distribution was rotated in every iteration to resemble a rolling motion. The computed signals were then cross-correlated to the signal of a reference flux density $\mathbf{B}_\text{ref}$ caused by a point-like magnetic momentum located in the geometric center of the same sphere.
\begin{align}
	\mathbf{B}(t) &= \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{A_{\text{Sensor}}} \int_{-\frac{l}{2}}^{\frac{l}{2}} \int_{-\frac{w}{2}}^{\frac{w}{2}} \frac{\mu_{o}}{4 \pi}\left(\frac{3 \mathbf{r}_{i}(t)\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}(t) \cdot \mathbf{m}_{i}\right)}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}(t)\right|^{5}}-\frac{\mathbf{m}_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}(t)\right|^{3}}\right) \text{dx dy} \label{eq:magneticFluxIntegral} \\
	\mathbf{R}_\text{sig}(t) &= - \mathbf{B}(t) \times \frac{S}{100} \times R + R \label{eq:GMR-signal}\\
	\mathbf{V}_\text{sig}(t) &= \frac{\mathbf{R}_\text{sig}(t)}{R + \mathbf{R}_\text{sig}(t)}\times V_\text{p} - \frac{V_\text{p}}{2} \label{eq:voltage-signal}
\end{align}
By its formula, cross-correlation $R_\text{x y}(\tau)$ yields a displacement dependent signal through its convolution of the complex conjugated reference signal $\mathrm{V}_\text{ref}^{*}(t)$ with the sample signal $\mathbf{V}_\text{sig}(t+\tau)$.(\cref{eq:xcorr}) Therefor, only the maximal correlation of this function was considered in further analyses.
\begin{equation}
	\mathrm{max}\{R_\text{x y}(\tau)\}=\mathrm{max}\left\{\int \mathrm{V}_\text{ref}^{*}(t) \mathbf{V}_\text{sig}(t+\tau) \text{dt} \right\} \label{eq:xcorr}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Single Cell Signal}
Aim of these simulations is to find a measure of how magnetic labeling of a cell affects signal shape and its subsequent analysis. A single cell with a surface coverage of \SIrange{5}{99}{\percent} of a densely packed sphere was loaded randomly with \glspl{mnp} at different sizes. Then, the previously explained rolling motion over the sensor bridge was simulated with the parameters specified in \cref{tab:params:mag_sim}. After correlating of the resulting signal voltage to the reference dipole (\cref{fig:sim:intro:coverage}, \blueCircle), each with three equal, randomly distributed \gls{mnp} coverages, the dependency on the coat was evaluated. As shown in the schematic \cref{fig:sim:intro:coverage}, an increase in signal peak amplitude but also in \gls{fwhm} at growing coverage was expected .

\label{tab:params:mag_sim}
\end{table}

The expected behavior matches the data analysis (\cref{fig:sim:coverage}). Each two analyzed sphere diameters \SIlist{4;8}{\micro\meter} with \gls{mnp} sizes ranging from \SI{20}{\nano\meter} to \SI{2}{\micro\meter}, show a great \gls{sem} at low coverage. This very probably is subjected to the momenta of single particles which play a greater individual role and hence influence the signal shape significantly because the overall dipole momentum in the sensor loses homogeneity. \\
Another observable effect is related to the \gls{mnp} size. Absolute correlation differs from \SI{20}{\nano\meter} to the ten and hundered fold diameter significantly. This can be related to the magnetic momentum per \gls{mnp} as it is dependent on the volume - thus $r^3$. However, for bigger magnetic particles this does not completely hold true because the composition changes from pure magnetite to a polymer shell with embedded oxide core at around \SI{150}{\nano\meter}. Nevertheless, larger particles carry also greater magnetic momentum which brings the aforementioned influence of single \glspl{mnp} into consideration. \\ 
Further, the densely packed sphere surface can evidently carry more smaller than larger \glspl{mnp}. This ranges from \num{641600} \gls{mnp} at \SI{20}{\nano\meter} to \num{81} at \SI{2}{\micro\meter} for a sphere radius of \SI{4}{\micro\meter} and thus limits the maximum achievable momentum. \\
In reality, a maximum immunomagnetic label density depends not on the densely packed sphere but rather on the present antigens, and association or dissociation constants. Therefore, a complete saturation coverage is not achievable under physiological conditions. When using smaller particle sizes, it has to be taken into consideration that a cumulative magnetic moment limited by the number of antigens and the detection limit of the sensing setup.

A cross-correlation increase which is inversely proportional to the \gls{mnp} size can be observed.}
\label{fig:sim:coverage}
\end{figure}

Also, it can be seen that the correlation approaches a maximum obtainable value for every \gls{mnp} size. Referenced for both simulated sphere diameters in \cref{fig:sim:CorrDiff:abs}, a inverse proportionality between correlation and \gls{mnp} diameter is visible. The trend in respective maxima can be attributed to variations in the magnetic momentum, and to coverage inhomogeneity. \\ 
Inter-sphere compared, maximum correlation shows also a significant deterioration for higher \gls{mnp} sizes as the particle diameter itself increases. The relative error between both sizes - as computed in \cref{eq:sim:relCorrDiff} -  is depicted in \cref{fig:sim:CorrDiff:rel}. Assuming a dependency on the available particle surface and subsequently the fraction which can be occupied by \glspl{mnp}, a quadratic fit seems appropriate.(\cref{eq:sim:quadFit}) The fit indicates probably that a cell covered with small \glspl{mnp} resembles a magnetic dipole located in the center of the cell while the correlation error becomes nearly constant at great \glspl{mnp}.
\begin{align}
	\text{Relative\ Correlation\ Difference} &= 1- \frac{\max\{\text{Cross-Correlation}(d=\SI{4}{\micro\meter})\}}{\max\{\text{Cross-Correlation}(d = \SI{8}{\micro\meter})\}} \label{eq:sim:relCorrDiff}\\

\end{align}
\subsection{Cell Aggregates}
In another simulation, two \SI{200}{\nano\meter}-\gls{mnp}-covered spheres were attached to each other in differing angles and simulated flowing over the sensor. Signal similarity to a magnetic dipole in the center of a single reference sphere was computed by cross-correlation. As can be observed in \cref{fig:sim:aggregates}, correlation is identical to a single sphere at low coverage, above a threshold magnetization. Here, the randomly distributed particles span an inhomogeneous magnetic field of a larger sphere which cannot be subdivided in the two singular parts.\\
With growing coverage, each cell starts to form an independent dipole. At occupancies greater than \SI{50}{\percent}, the two attached cells are in such superposition. Now, the sensor detects not a single particle as for less coverage but two spatially close particles. Consequentially, the signal is an interference pattern of the two singular events and thus carries small peaks in the center. This is shown schematically in \cref{fig:sim:intro:angle}. In term, this causes a high signal deviation from the reference and a low degree of correlation effectively.

\section{The MRCyte Simulation Framework}
In this work, also an analytical simulation framework that is capable of simulating the synergy of multiple microfluidic effects was developed. The comprehensive framework features magnetic, fluid dynamic and biochemical processes inside the utilized microfluidic channel which act on a particle. Foremost, material parameters were stored inside the ``MRCyte'' class, which ranged from channel and particle properties to binding and friction constants. Basic velocity, shear and magnetic field computations build the core of the presented program. Additionally, several dimensionless parameters such as the Stokes or \gls{re} or particle properties can be computed.\\
With that, simulations of the fluid dynamics that influence a single microbead as well as force-equilibrium computations for the same bead were carried out.

\subsection{Fluid Fields inside the Microchannel}
\label{sec:res:fluidSim}
The simulation framework provided a quantitative generation of the Hagen-Poiseuille flow profile inside the microchannel with the numerical solution of \cref{eq:flowRateRect}. The simulated channel had dimensions (\gls{chanW} $\times$ \gls{chanH} $\times$ \gls{chanL}) \SI{700}{\micro\meter} $\times$ \SI{150}{\micro\meter} $\times$ \SI{15800}{\micro\meter}. The flow rate was adopted to \SI{80}{\micro\liter\per\minute}.\footnote{in accordance with the experimentally determined value} Tubing as well as time dependent effects were neglected. \\
The simulated \gls{u} for the whole channel cross-section can be observed in \cref{fig:sim:flowShear:vel:full}. Due to the no-slip boundary condition, \gls{u} is zero on the margin while the maximum of is reached in the geometric center. \gls{umean} in the channel ensues \SI{12670.84}{\micro\meter\per\second}.\\
Conjointly, computation of the flow gradient in vertical direction and scaling with \gls{eta} yield the shear stress field.(\cref{fig:sim:flowShear:shear:full}) As the curvature of \gls{u} is zero in the channel center and maximal at the edges, the shear stress reaches highest values symmetrically at the horizontal edges of the channel.\footnote{Because the horizontal components of the gradients were neglected graceless} Resulting, the net viscous shear $\boldsymbol{\tau}_\text{viscous} = \frac{\partial u}{\partial z}$ cancels out over the whole channel cross-section.

Additionally, \gls{u} and \gls{tau_v} acting on a \SI{8}{\micro\meter} diameter bead on the channel bottom were analyzed.(\cref{fig:sim:flowShear:vel:particle,fig:sim:flowShear:shear:particle}) In the proximity of a wall and due to the applied boundary conditions, \gls{tau_v} enclosed by the bead surface is non-linear. Thus, the mean fluid velocity exposed to the bead amounts in $\overline{\mathbf{u}_\text{p}}$ =  \SI{2241.59}{\micro\meter\per\second}, whereas  $\overline{\boldsymbol{\tau}_\text{viscous,\, p}}$ strains with \SI{4.93}{\dyne\per\square\centi\meter}.

\subsection{Modelling the Force-Equilibrium of a Rolling Bead over a Biofunctionalized Surface}
\label{sec:res:forcesim}
\todo{nice intro}
With the supplier's parameters of a \SI{8}{\micro\meter} micromer-M bead (micromod Partikeltechnologie GmbH, Rostock) the corrected drag force on a bead on the bottom of the standard utilized microchannel results in \SI{463.65}{\pico\newton} for \SI{80}{\micro\liter\per\minute}. This is computed from the \cref{eq:f:drag} and the correction factor in \cref{eq:f:drag:corr:wall_approx}, where the simulated flow field integrated over the particle surface was plugged into.\\
If the bead was functionalized with biotin under negligence of the differential equations for the association constants, the number of interacting groups would result in the present surface charges. Surface charge density results in \SI{1}{\micro\mole\per\gram} of \gls{carboxyl} and \gls{amine} beads as of the supplier's data sheet. Hence, a fully saturated bead is covered with \num{177500} biotin molecules.\\
The streptavidin coverage of the channel floor was modeled in excess over the biotin ligands and penetration depth was estimated by the size of several monolayers of protein. As described by \citet{lit:fluidic:ModelMIT}, an approach of \SI{30}{\nano\meter} is a reasonable quantity. In turn, the surfaces were in contact with \SI{1.51}{\micro\meter\squared} which constitutes \SI{0.75}{\percent} of the \SI{8}{\micro\meter} bead surface. This reveals that \num{1329} biotin molecules can interact with the floor. A summation of the \gls{f:protein} at \SIrange{5}{150}{\pico\newton} per streptavidin-biotin bond yields the resulting adhesion force with a magnitude of \SIrange{6.7}{199}{\nano\newton}.\cite{lit:bio:biotin:rupture} 

The binding force is in the same range as the perpendicular magnetophoretic force caused by the permanent magnet under the sensor chip ($\nabla \mathbf{B}$ = \SI{10}{\tesla\per\meter}) as well as by the nickel-iron chevron structures on the chip ($\nabla \mathbf{B}$ $\approxeq$ \SI{5}{\kilo\tesla\per\meter}). Clearly, in the near-field approximation the nickel-iron structures dominate \gls{f:mag} (\cref{eq:f:mag}). With the manufacturer given saturation momentum of one particle (\SI{1.12}{\pico\ampere\meter\squared}), the magnetic attraction force eventuates in \SI{5.6}{\nano\newton} in the magnetophoresis section of the channel.

\begin{align}
	\mathbf{F}_\parallel = \mathbf{F}_\text{drag} - C_\text{rr} \cdot (\mathbf{F}_\text{mag} \ +\ \mathbf{F}_\text{protein}  \ +\ \mathbf{F}_\text{grav}\ -\ \mathbf{F}_\text{shear} ) \label{eq:f:balance} \\
	C_\text{rr} = \sqrt{\frac{\text{z}}{d}} = \sqrt{\frac{\SI{30}{\nano\meter}}{\SI{8}{\micro\meter}}} = \num{0.0612} \label{eq:corr:roll}
\end{align}

In order to merge this analytic force balance, all remaining forces have to be projected into the direction of \acrfull{f:drag}.(\cref{eq:f:balance}) This is achieved by the introduction of a \gls{corrRoll} for a perfectly elastic surface.(\cref{eq:corr:roll}) In a first order approximation, the factor depends only on the \acrfull{z} and the bead diameter ($d$). However, scientific literature about the rolling resistance of microbeads on microfluidic or protein covered surfaces does not exist yet to confirm this macroscopic factor for the microscale. \\
Scaling all orthogonal forces to the \acrlong{f:drag} with \gls{corrRoll} yields a net positive result (\SI{154.08}{\pico\newton}) for an unfunctionalized surface (\gls{f:protein} $\overset{!}{=}$ \num{0}) which indicates a rolling motion in flow direction. Notwithstanding, above a critical interaction number of \numrange{503}{16} biotin-streptavidin bonds - for the respective release forces of \SIrange{5}{150}{\pico\newton} per linkage - the particle resists \acrlong{f:drag} and adheres to the surface.

This behavior will be exploited in further measurements for ``bead loss experiments'' in order to measure a concentration difference with different degrees of biotinylated beads.

\section{Reference Bead Surface Functionalization}
\label{sec:res:beadFunc}
After simulation of their respective coverages, biotin was titrated on \SI{8}{\micro\meter} reference beads with two different surface terminations in order to selectively bind \glspl{mnp} with the counter-agent streptavidin to the surface. First, \gls{amine}-microbeads were modified by sulfo-NHS-biotin. Second, \gls{carboxyl}-beads were coated by amine-PEG$_2$-biotin via EDC-NHS-activation. On the same beads Anti-IgG1-PE antibodies were titrated after the same coupling chemistry.\\
Subsequently, biotin-coated beads were analyzed in the flow cytometer in the by staining with Atto-488 (Ex: \SI{500}{\nano\meter}, Em: \SI{520}{\nano\meter}) coupled streptavidin. The antibody was modified with \gls{pe} and measured at \SI{488}{\nano\meter} excitation and \SI{585}{\nano\meter}  emission wavelength. The gating was standardized by the strategy found in \cref{sec:meth:beadCharact}, \cref{fig:gatingstrategy-layout}. Subsequently, the \gls{mfi} was computed and fitted with a sigmoidal Hill-function.(\cref{eq:hill}) Stability of carboxylated and aminated beads and subsequently their respective modification protocols was evaluated for \SI{12}{days}.


\subsection{Amine-Surface Biotinylation}
As first approach, polystyrene copolymer microbeads with \SI{8}{\micro\meter} diameter were functionalized by (sulfo-)NHS-biotin after a standard protocol from Thermo Fisher Scientic and micromod. A titration of the biotin reactant yielded a varying surface coverage as shown in \cref{fig:biotinyl:titration:nh2}. During this one-pot-reaction, the water-soluble sulfo-NHS-biotin forms an \gls{amide} linkage with the primary \gls{amine} and \iupac{1-\-hydroxy\--2,5-\-dioxo\-pyrrolidine-\-3-\-sulfonate} splits off as byproduct.\\
As can be seen from the \gls{sem} error-bars from the plot \ref{fig:biotinyl:titration:nh2}, which were obtained from three true biological replicates, this process is highly reproducible. Therefore, surface coverage in different grades of biotinylation could be incurred accurately with a \gls{rsquadj} of \num{0.981} for the resulting Hill fit.

\subsection{Carboxylate-Surface Functionalization}
In a second approach, particles with opposite partial surface charge, mediated through \gls{carboxyl} groups, have been functionalized. In turn, particles were pre-activated in \gls{edc} and \gls{nhs} in \gls{mes}/\gls{mest} buffer. There are two distinct reasons for the usage of \gls{mes} based buffers rather than \gls{pbs} or \gls{macs}. First, \gls{edc} has its reactive maximum at \pH\ \numrange{5}{6}. Second, buffers containing primary \glspl{amine} (TRIS / glycine) or \glspl{carboxyl} (acetate / citrate) will quench the reaction and therefore limit the efficacy.\\
Afterwards, the beads were washed carefully and incubated with \gls{amine}-\acrshort{peg}$_2$-biotin. Here, \gls{peg} indicates a hydrophilic spacer arm between both functional groups and in this case has length of a two units. The full functionalization procedure is explained in more detail in \cref{fig:chem:COOH-EDC-NHS}. \\
As shown in \cref{fig:biotinyl:titration:cooh}, particles were functionalized equally compared to \gls{amide} surfaces. However, the stability of \gls{carboxyl} particles yields a half-life of \SI{1.43}{days} in a continuous measurement over \SI{12}{days} with a subsequent exponential fit. Additionally, both procedures show an outlier at high concentrations which could not be explained during the course of this thesis. 

Third, \gls{carboxyl}ated particles have been also functionalized with the Anti-IgG1-\gls{pe} antibody. Again, a Hill-shaped titration curve was achieved, but due to the costly reagent a saturated surface coverage was not reached. (\cref{fig:biotinyl:titration:igg}) \\
Therefor, the fit curve has to be interpreted cautiously. Although it converged and represents the data with an \gls{rsquadj} of \SI{99.2}{\percent}, the goodness of fit determined by the reduced $\chi^2$ statistic results in a value of \num{278.1} which indicates an underestimation of the error variance.

\section{Concentration Measurements in MRCyte}
\label{sec:res:ConcMeas}
Driving factor for the concentration measurement is the absolute count of immunomagnetically labeled cells in diluted or whole blood which is not possible in today's optics-based devices due to the excess of \glspl{rbc}.\cite{lit:bio:Alberts} Therefore, with the in \cref{sec:theo:magnet} described deterministic approach of cell focusing for subsequent magnetic detection, absolute concentrations of magnetic reference beads were attempted to measure.\\
Beads with acrylate surface were pumped through a microfluidic channel with a permanent magnet underneath. The magnet drew every magnetic particle to the ground, where they were focused on the sensor bridge and subsequently measured there. From the received signal several parameters such as peak amplitudes, locations, zero-crossings, and relative distances between each other were computed.(\cref{fig:conc:example}) Especially for the concentration measurement a correct detection of bead signals from the noisy stream or from a superposition of multiple, simultaneously measured particles was critical. The related error sources and countermeasures will be elaborated in \cref{sec:res:Correction}.

\begin{figure}[b]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.7\linewidth]{Ressources/Simulation/ExampleSignal}
	\capption{Example Signal of Magnetic Measurement}{Signals generated from the Wheatstone bridge sensor setup feature a certain shape which allows for several measures. In case the overall signal stream carries a constant or linear offset, it is scaled to the means before and after the detected peak pattern. (\textcolor{OlightBlue}{Mean1, Mean2}) The x- and y-positions of each peak are denominated by \textcolor{Oorange}{B1-4} and \textcolor{Ogreen}{Amp1-4}, respectively. The crossings of the signal through the linear connection of both means are denominated by \textcolor{OdarkBlue}{n1-3} (in the figure by \darkBlueCircle). Further, the difference between the equally oriented peaks \textcolor{Oorange}{B3}-\textcolor{Oorange}{B1} and \textcolor{Oorange}{B4}-\textcolor{Oorange}{B2} give a measure for the homogeneous movement of the measured object and are called \textcolor{Oyellow}{A1} and \textcolor{Oyellow}{A2} each. From these values the overall velocity $v$ can be approximated because the \gls{dgmr} and \gls{fs} is fixed precisely. Analogously, the magnetic diameter of a dipole is computed by the mean of the differences \textcolor{Oorange}{B2}-\textcolor{Oorange}{B1} and \textcolor{Oorange}{B4}-\textcolor{Oorange}{B3}.}
	\label{fig:conc:example}
\end{figure}

By measuring the absolute concentration with a commercially available flow cytometer (MacsQuant 10, Miltenyi), a reference bead count was established. In a pre-test, beads were taken directly from the microcentrifuge tube, after pumping through a syringe, and after pumping through a syringe with \SI{10}{\centi\meter} of connected through tubing (ID \SI{0.5}{\milli\meter}, RS Chemicals). Afterwards, they were counted in the flow cytometer in equal volumes. Additionally, two different buffers - \gls{macs} and \gls{pbs} - and two different surface terminations were used. Both buffers are based on \acrfull{pbs}. Notwithstanding \gls{macs} contains \gls{edta} as chelator for divalent ions, Tween 20 - a non-ionic surfactant -, and an azide-based stabilizer. Hence, the wetting of surfaces and the electrostatic interactions of these buffers differ. The same properties were varied on the bead surface by choosing acrylate- and biotin-terminated beads.\\
In \cref{fig:conc:losses_syringe}, a trend (without statistical confidence) can be observed that shows a decrease in particle counts after every additional surface which beads could potentially interact with. In term, a correct count in absolute numbers seems out of range. However, a calibration of the system with the flow profile inside the channel to compensate for losses subjected to connectors and magnetic enrichment structures was carried out successfully.

\subsection{Measurement Error Sources and Calibration of Flow Field}
\label{sec:res:Correction}
In order to account for the bead losses due to the tubing connectors, the Hagen-Poiseuille flow profile, and magnetophoretic enrichment structures, the measured bead concentration was corrected in two different approaches.(\cref{eq:corr:conc}) On the one hand side, the typical assay correction to the ground truth by a constant \gls{corrConst} computed from the blank population was established. On the other side, a \gls{corrVel} compared the \acrfull{umean} to the \gls{vc}.
\begin{equation}	
	c_\text{beads,\, expected} = c_\text{beads,\, measured}  \cdot C \label{eq:corr:conc}
\end{equation}
The \gls{corrConst} relates a reference count in the optical flow cytometer to the measurement in the magnetic flow cytometer.(\cref{eq:corr:const}) Equally-adjusted bead concentrations in the samples allow for a correction to the reference system. However, for an assay usage the initial concentration of beads either has to be known precisely or has to be irrelevant, for example in regards of a standardized measurement procedure. Besides, \gls{corrConst} provides a reliable and generalizable option for correction. 
\begin{align}
	C_const &= \frac{c_\text{beads, standard procedure}}{c_\text{beads, MRCyte}} \label{eq:corr:const}\\
	v_\text{c} &= 2\ d_\text{gmr} \frac{f_\text{s}}{n_\text{3}-n_\text{1}} \label{eq:v:c} \\
	C_\text{velocity} &= \frac{\overline{\mathbf{u}}}{v_\text{c}} = \frac{Q}{A \cdot v_\text{c}} \label{eq:corr:vel} 
\end{align}

In contrast, \gls{corrConst} can intrinsically correct only well below \SI{100}{\percent}. (\textbf{b}) Mean and \gls{sem} of a fit-corrected bead capture experiment with several error sources. Initially, the magnetophoretic structures have to be filled and thus decrease the plain count for the first \SI{100}{\micro\liter}. (\orangeline) Additionally, the high deviation offsets the correction factor so that the stable measurement from \SIrange{100}{200}{\micro\liter} lies now above the ideal reference. In contrast, the biotinylated beads are captures by the surface functionalization and hence a very low concentration is measured. However, a steep rise with pulsations can be observed when the surface is saturated with beads and the particles begin to flow over the sensor in bursts. (\blueline) The abrupt decline to the end of the measured volume is most probably related to sedimentation effects inside the emptying syringe.}

\end{figure}
\clearpage
The \gls{corrVel} relates the effective particle velocity to the total fluid velocity in order to eradicate flow profile provoked effects.(\cref{eq:corr:vel}) Whereas \gls{umean} was determined by \acrfull{q} through a cross-sectional \gls{a} of the channel, \gls{vc} was analyzed from the measured signal stream. Here, the intrinsic \acrfull{dgmr} was divided by the time difference where the bead passed exactly over a half bridge with known distance.(\cref{eq:v:c}) These specific timepoints are visible as dimensionless zero-crossings $n_\text{1}$ and $n_\text{3}$ in the signal and can be converted by scaling with the \acrfull{fs} into the time domain.(\cref{fig:conc:AbsConcError:concerror})

	\label{fig:conc:AbsConcError}
\end{figure}
However, if the bead velocity is not solely dependent on fluid dynamic effects - especially in the light of surface functionalizations - \gls{corrVel} can not be applied to experiments robustly. This is depicted in a sample experiment with a protein covered surface in \cref{fig:conc:AbsConcError:concerror}. By definition, the \gls{corrConst} can not be well above than \SI{100}{\percent} whereas the count correction by \gls{corrVel} differs by \SI{600}{\percent} through variations in the velocity measurement.(\cref{fig:conc:BiotnylWrongCorr:velConst}) \\
An adaptation of these corrections to real measurements are depicted in \cref{fig:conc:AbsConcError}. In a measurement where \SI{300}{\micro\liter} were dispensed into the magnetic flow cytometer with a defined particle concentration the counts were analyzed and corrected according to above. This time, the channel had a cross-section of \SI{700}{\micro\meter} $\times$ \SI{50}{\micro\meter} (\gls{chanW} $\times$ \gls{chanH}) and \gls{q} was set to \SI{30}{\micro\liter\per\minute}.\\
Apart from a reproducible count over the dynamic range of almost two decades, both correction factors ameliorated the present data. \gls{corrConst} amounted in an optimum \num{2,89 +- 0,08} while \gls{corrVel} centered around a mean of \num{2,26}. Consequently, the velocity correction was misguided by \SI{21.7}{\percent} for the advantage of requiring no \textit{a priori} knowledge about the measurement.\\
Another peculiarity of \gls{corrVel} can be observed in \cref{fig:conc:AbsConcError:vel}. While the analyzed velocity is stable for less than \SI{10}{\per\micro\liter}, a linear decrease is visible for higher concentrations. This is a consequence when signals of beads start overlapping if these are flowing over the sensor in a close vicinity. Hence, the disturbed signal sensitizes the parameter reconstruction to errors such as false peak-identification.
\subsection{Concentration Measurement in Diluted Whole Blood}
\label{sec:res:wholeBlood}
The same concentration measurements from before were now carried out in whole blood samples. Here, the reference count can be attained only below the experimentally determined critical concentration around \SI{10}{\per\micro\liter}. (\cref{fig:conc:blood}) An insignificant discrepancy could be perceived in different volumetric blood to buffer dilutions of 1:1 and 1:20, respectively. This provides evidence for the measurement's independence from the blood concentration in buffer. \\
However, a significant difference between counts was discovered between a \SI{150}{\micro\meter} high channel, where \gls{corrVel} can be determined accurately, and a \SI{50}{\micro\meter} high channel, where the correction yields a great error to the reference. This may be subjected to an increased probability of collisions from beads with blood cells and hence a decreased velocity which in turn leads to a higher correction factor. Another explanation approach could be the transition from \textit{Newtonian} to \textit{Non-Newtonian} fluid dynamics in smaller cross-sections, which could likewise be influenced by the F\aa{}r\ae{}us effects mentioned in \cref{sec:theo:faraeus}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Differential Counting Setup}
\label{sec:res:diffCounting}
With regard to the necessity of correction factors in order to resolve the ground truth of a concentration measurement, a different magnetic flow cytometer setup has been evaluated. Here, two fully assembled sensors with \glspl{pcb} were stacked on top of each other and connected in series which was expected to yield two beneficial effects.\\
First, one permanent magnet underneath the lower sensor chip should supply both chips with enough gradient field to pull beads to the respective channel bottom. Second, simultaneous signal acquisition should act on the one side as a time-of-flight detector with a relatively long transport distance and on the other side, a differential concentration measurement was envisioned between both chips. Therefor, the hypothetical optimum parameter set could be reached when the relative concentration measurement yielded identity:
\begin{equation}
	\dfrac{c_\text{\ top sensor}}{c_\text{\ bottom\ sensor}} \overset{!}{=} 1
	\label{eq:diff:optimum}
\end{equation}
The system comprises of two separately assembled sensor \glspl{pcb} with nylon spacers between the positional screws.(\cref{fig:diff:sensitivity})  A \SI{3}{\milli\meter} hole was drilled into the top \gls{pcb} carefully between the strip lines to minimize the tubing length from the top chip outlet to the bottom chip inlet. 
After the build-up of the differential counting system,\footnote{as described in \cref{sec:meth:dualGMR}} the hysteresis of both sensor elements was maximized for sensitivity and the concentration was measured against a reference from the optical flow cytometer. 

\subsubsection{Sensitivity Calibration}
Initially, the permanent magnet was adjusted in three linear directions in order to maximize the magnetic sensitivity of both Wheatstone bridges. Schematically, this can be envisioned as a placement of the whole top as well as the whole bottom bridge configuration into the operational range of the magnet, which is indicated by the blue triangle.

Then, the hysteresis of both outermost and one centered sensor was optimized for their full coverage and sensitivity. The recorded values for a sole optimization of the top or bottom sensor array with a height variation of the utilized nylon spacers are shown in \cref{fig:diff:sensitivity:optTop,fig:diff:sensitivity:optBottom}. Apparently, the optimized sensor exhibits a monotonously higher \gls{mr} than the disregarded bridge. Nevertheless, the complete sensor setup features a \gls{mr} well above \SI{7.2}{\percent} which is acceptable both for measuring immunomagnetically labeled cells and magnetic microbeads. Furthermore, the homogeneity of the interspersing magnetic field can be monitored in the triangular shape of every acquired curve in the sensitivity plots. As the field vectors of \gls{B} start to disperse at the outsides of the illustrated blue area in \cref{fig:diff:sensitivity}c, the outer sensor regions are not located completely inside a homogeneous gradient field and get distracted by non-perpendicular field components.\citet{lit:thes:helou} \\
Additionally, no influence of any spacer height could be discovered.  The difference in \gls{mr} varied insignificantly in \SI{0.14 +- 0.6}{\percent} of \gls{mr}.

\subsubsection{Magnetic Concentration Measurement with the Differential Sensor Setup}
Due to the single utilized permanent magnet for two sensors, another field related issue arose during concentration measurements. This requires a step back inside the general functionality of the magnetophoretic enrichment:\\
Any bead flowing at an arbitrary position in the microchannel experiences a negative magnetic force by the gradient of the \acrlong{B} caused by the permanent magnet which pulls perpendicular to the bottom surface. Upon coming in close proximity to the lower boundary, a gradient provoked by the lithographic nickel-iron structures starts to gain strength with the third power of the distance. This causes the beads to attach to the bottom firmly and enforces their rolling behavior. However, a fragile equilibrium between magnetophoresis and drag has to be maintained slightly in favor of \acrlong{f:drag} for a continuous rolling motion.

This ideal state is a narrow space in between two boundary cases:\\
First, if drag force exceeds magnetophoresis, the beads will not migrate to the channel bottom in the top chip and hence result in a lower concentration measured on top. Second, if magnetophoresis outnumbers drag so that particles flow steadily in the top channel, the beads in the lower channel will stop rolling and adhere. In effect, the lower concentration measurement is compromised. This behavior is visible in the \cref{fig:diff:sensitivity:top,fig:diff:sensitivity:bottom}.\\
In order to find the flow rate for the optimal ratio between drag and magnetic force, measurements were performed with bead concentrations ranging from \SIrange{8.5}{34}{\per\micro\liter}. The respective quotient was determined after \cref{eq:diff:optimum} and plotted in \cref{fig:diff:optimum}. Below an optimal threshold of \SI{160+-10}{\micro\liter\per\minute}, the top sensor measures up to the 100-fold concentration of the bottom sensor. Above the threshold, the top sensor starts to miss counts which is subjected to a high drag force relatively to the magnetophoresis. The quotient of both sensors shows a linearly decreasing trend towards a saturation at high flow rates where no beads are measured by both sensors.\\
Hereby, the intersection of all measured concentrations does not reside in \num{1}, at the optimal value of the quotient. This can on the one side be attributed to the numerical velocity correction and on the other side to the losses in the interconnection between both chips. Although, the optimal quotient value would have been \num{1} theoretically, an ideal overlap was found for a flow rate of \SI{150}{\micro\liter\per\minute}.

The determined optimal flow rate prohibits a functionalization inside the respective channel due to the high shear forces of \SI{11.8}{\dyne\per\centi\meter}. Therefore, a bio-functionalized channel has to be designed with a greater hydrodynamic diameter to lower velocity and shear. Therefore, two channels have been designed and probed initially. First, a simple serpentine channel with a width of \SI{1}{\milli\meter} has been developed to bond onto an assembled sensor.(\cref{fig:app:serpentine}) Second, in another approach, a focusing structure with an aperture of \SI{30}{\micro\meter} width for the sensor element itself has been designed.(\cref{fig:app:focus}) However, the difficulties in assembly and operation of the whole setup inhibited a further usage in experiments.

First, BNF-Dextran-redF-streptavidin \SI{100}{\nano\meter} \glspl{mnp} (micromod Partikeltechnologie GmbH, Rostock) were attached to the non-magnetic beads after the protocol in \cref{sec:meth:coatingMNPs}. Then, the magnetizability was examined qualitatively in a magnet stand. Particles were considered ``magnetically labeled'' if a pellet was visible after \SI{10}{\minute}. Afterwards, the concentrations were measured with the optical flow cytometer and adjusted to \SI{10 +- 1}{\per\micro\liter} accordingly.

The subsequent measurement of \SI{300}{\micro\liter} in the magnetic flow cytometer is shown in \cref{fig:conc}. In \cref{fig:conc:BNF:c1} the peak difference C1 (= Amp2 - Amp1, \cref{fig:conc:example}) is presented against the biotinylation degree. Independent experiments of \SIlist{100;68}{\percent} biotinylation show a certain amplitude difference. The respective fluid and particle velocities in \cref{fig:conc:BNF:vc} provide an explanation for this behavior. The fluid velocity had to be adapted during the course of the experiments from \SIrange{80}{10}{\micro\liter\per\minute} in order to receive stable counts.\\
Keeping this in mind leads to the fact that - although only two biotinylation coverages were measured - four distinct magnetizations are represented here. Both \SI{100}{\percent} samples show slow but plausible velocities and can therefore be correlated with differing magnetic momentum. Beads with \SI{68}{\percent} show an exceptional velocity and can hence either be considered as noisy background or a very weakly magnetized particles that are not pulled to the channel bottom completely. This could also explain the decline in C1 which is also a measure for \acrlong{m}.

Second, SV0050 \SI{50}{\nano\meter} streptavidin \glspl{mnp} (OceanNanotech, San Diego, USA) were deposited after the equal procedure on \SI{8}{\micro\meter} polystyrene beads. These experiments show the expected result of declining peak amplitude at lower biotinylation and constant velocity throughout. (\cref{fig:conc:Ocean:C,fig:conc:Ocean:vc}) At a p-value smaller than \SI{10}{\percent}, the high populations differ significantly from each other while the log-normal fits match the histograms with a \gls{rsquadj} of \num{0.94}.\\
Two hypotheses can be drawn now from this result. On the one side, OceanNanotech \glspl{mnp} could posses more magnetic momentum per particle, which favors the robust measurement. On the other side, streptavidin or \gls{mnp} size could influence the saturation of all available biotin sites of the particle.

\section{Surface Modification and Biofunctionalization of the Sensor Chip Substrate}
\label{sec:res:surfMod}
In consideration of the problems of surface instability analyzed in \cref{sec:res:Correction} and to avoid additional uncertainties in the experimental validation of the model from \cref{sec:res:forcesim}, a covalent functionalization of the sensor surface with neutravidin was carried out. First, a plate reader experiment for a qualitative statement about the shear-force stability of protein adsorption was performed. Second, different functionalization approaches with \gls{piranha} and \gls{hf} were tested with pure glass, \gls{pdms}, and eventually \gls{sin}. Third the validation of these procedures was limited to indirect measurements such as tensiometry, fluorescence microscopy, and quantitative bead capture assay, as sophisticated chemical analyses were hardly available.

\subsection{Physisorption}
\label{sec:res:physis}
In order to quantify the adsorption stability for fluorescently-labeled, physisorbed streptavidin molecules, sensor chips were cut into \SI{10}{\milli\meter\squared} pieces and glued to the bottom of a 96-well plate. Subsequently, they were equilibrated with \gls{pbs} and incubated with \SI{1}{\milli\gram\per\milli\liter} over night. Each measurement was corrected for a blank substrate as well as the negative control with plain \gls{pbs} buffer and normalized subsequently.

The samples were subsequently washed with \SI{200}{\micro\liter} \gls{pbs} carefully. Fluorescence intensities were of corrected with a blank substrate, the autofluorescence of \gls{pbs}, and normalized eventually. Every surface reaches a mean fluorescence level of \SI{28}{\percent} after few washing steps.}
	\label{fig:unsp:wash}
\end{figure}
Every sample in the plate reader showed a significant surface decrease to a mean level of \SI{28}{\percent} from the original fluorescence.(\cref{fig:unsp:wash}) Whereas proteins desorbed from both crystals after the first washing steps equally, \gls{sin} outperformed \gls{alox} as more stable in steady state. (\SI{34.8}{\percent} vs. \SI{27.5}{\percent}) However, no quantitative hypothesis could be formulated by these numbers due to the nature of their indirect measurement. Hence, the protein activity which is the crucial quantity for any bead rolling remains questionable. Nevertheless, a qualitative proposition is strongly confirmed that unspecifically adsorbed proteins are removed from any of both surfaces rapidly.


\subsection{Evaluation of the Covalent Biofunctionalization with Optical Methods}
\label{sec:res:coval}
Now, the results of several covalent surface modification procedures with various substrates are presented. Foremost, glass was used as main carrier material. On glass established protocols were then brought onto \gls{pdms} and \gls{sin} chips. As main functionalization protocol, an activation in 7:1 \gls{piranha} was carried out for \SI{30}{\minute}. Then, the substrate was rinsed, incubated in \SI{2}{\percent} \gls{aptes} solution and in \gls{paa} subsequently after the protocol described in \cref{sec:meth:surfFunc}. Then a \SI{150}{\micro\meter} microfluidic channel was glued to the functionalized substrate and eventually filled with \SI{1}{\milli\gram\per\milli\liter} of neutravidin or streptavidin-atto488, if fluorescent labeling was intended. A constant flow rate of \SI{80}{\micro\liter\per\minute} was selected for the bead capture assays under the light microscope. The general process chain is depicted in \cref{fig:chem:func:withPAA}.


As a final result, a chemical and biological functionalization could be established to a similar degree as unspecific binding. Measuring the count of beads per occupied area yields \cref{fig:coval:densitysubstrate}. Again, two distinct states can be observed for biotinylated and plain beads at every modified surface.\\
The density of bound protein could also be varied through the incubation concentration and measured reliably both in a optical bead capture assay and the \gls{mfi} of the channel in a fluorescence microscope.(\cref{fig:coval:counts,fig:coval:titration}) The relative \gls{mfi} indicates here the fraction supra the non-functionalized, \gls{pbs}-filled microchannel. 

However, a substantially different long-term stability could neither be measured nor compared to similar results accurately. Also, no proof for the covalent functionalization could be brought with the available methods. Nevertheless, a robust and working protocol has been developed after significant literature values which encourages the position.

\section{Affinity-based Concentration Measurements in the Magnetic Flow Cytometer}
\label{sec:res:affinity}
In this section, a sensor was unspecifically functionalized with neutravidin. Subsequently, differently biotinylated, magnetic beads were pumped over the sensor which counted the non-adhering fraction.\\
In order to measure the interaction properties diligently, beads were functionalized with biotin at several saturation degrees ranging from \SIrange{0}{100}{\percent} total coverage of the available surface charges. Measurements for absolute counts as well as their time stability were carried out at \SI{80}{\micro\liter\per\minute} in a microchannel with cross-section \SI{700}{\micro\meter} $\times$ \SI{150}{\micro\meter}  (\gls{chanW} $\times$ \gls{chanH}). \cref{fig:conc:All:count} shows the absolute, linearly corrected counts determined by the magnetic flow cytometer, with a defined particle concentration of \SI{8.9+-1.1}{\per\micro\liter}.

It has been shown, that the biotinylation degree of microbeads can be measured robustly in the magnetic flow cytometer. For completely functionalized beads, only fractions well blow \SI{1}{\percent} were counted with small \gls{sem}.(\cref{fig:conc:All:count}, \SI{100}{\percent}). In result, fully- versus non-functionalized beads can be discriminated with high significance. Also, this measurement demonstrates a solid reproducibility with three different chip setups and measurement days indicated by \#1, \#2, and \#3.\\
For \SI{63.5}{\percent} biotinylated beads, a gradation of the counts can also be observed. This evidence strongly supports the possibility of an affinity-dependent, magnetic concentration measurement with the current system. However, due to the instability of the functionalization layer itself over the course of sequential measurements, additional experiments have to be conducted in order to reinforce these results.

An evaluation of the bead count distribution in the time-domain shows a stable baseline for fully biotinylated beads with a recovery in the single digit range per unit volume. In the negative control of unbiotinylated beads, also a noisy mean count around \SI{100}{\percent} can be observed.\footnote{The shown data corresponds to the mean of three measurements from \cref{fig:conc:All:count}} The unbiotinylated sample shows the previously discussed initial rise.(\cref{sec:res:Correction})
