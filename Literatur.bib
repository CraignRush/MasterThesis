 	abstract = "This report describes an optical sensing hybrid system obtained by bonding a microfluidic system to an integrated optical (IO) four-channel Young interferometer (YI) chip. The microfluidic system implemented into a glass plate consists of four microchannels with cross-sectional dimensions of 200μm×15μm. The microfluidic system is structured in such a way that after bonding to the IO chip, each microchannel addresses one sensing window in the four-channel YI sensor. Experimental tests show that the implementation of the microfluidics reduces the response time of the sensor from 100s, as achieved with a bulky cuvette, to 4s. Monitoring the anti-human serum albumine/human serum albumine (α-HSA/HSA) immunoreaction demonstrates the feasibility to use the microfluidic sensing system for immunosensing applications. In this case, a better discrimination between the bulk refractive index change and the layer formation can be made, resulting into higher accuracy and offering the prospect of being able to use the kinetics of the immunoreaction. The microfluidic sensing system shows an average phase resolution of 7×10−5×2π for different pairs of channels, which at the given interaction length of 4mm corresponds to a refractive index resolution of 6×10−8, being equivalent to a protein mass coverage resolution of 20fg/mm2."

 	ABSTRACT = {Ring resonator-based biosensors have found widespread application as the transducing principle in ''lab-on-a-chip'' platforms due to their sensitivity, small size and support for multiplexed sensing. Their sensitivity is, however, not inherently selective towards biomarkers, and surface functionalization of the sensors is key in transforming the sensitivity to be specific for a particular biomarker. There is currently no consensus on process parameters for optimized functionalization of these sensors. Moreover, the procedures are typically optimized on flat silicon oxide substrates as test systems prior to applying the procedure to the actual sensor. Here we present what is, to our knowledge, the first comparison of optimization of silanization on flat silicon oxide substrates to results of protein capture on sensors where all parameters of two conjugation protocols are tested on both platforms. The conjugation protocols differed in the chosen silanization solvents and protein immobilization strategy. The data show that selection of acetic acid as the solvent in the silanization step generally yields a higher protein binding capacity for C-reactive protein (CRP) onto anti-CRP functionalized ring resonator sensors than using ethanol as the solvent. Furthermore, using the BS3 linker resulted in more consistent protein binding capacity across the silanization parameters tested. Overall, the data indicate that selection of parameters in the silanization and immobilization protocols harbor potential for improved biosensor binding capacity and should therefore be included as an essential part of the biosensor development process.},

Neutron reflectometry and XPS showed that the oxygen plasma led to the formation of a smooth (<10nm), oxidised surface layer with a thickness of 130–160nm. The oxidised layer contained a mixture of the original polymer and silicon bonded to three or four oxygen atoms (SiOx). The oxidised layer was thinner after longer plasma exposure, indicating a decrease in specific volume due to a conversion of the polymer structure to an inorganic SiOx-rich structure. The formation of the SiOx-containing layer with low segmental mobility was further confirmed by the small hysteresis in the Wilhelmy balance measurements. The similarity in the hydrophobicity recovery kinetics of specimens aged in dry air, dry argon and vacuum and XPS data showed that the hydrophobicity recovery is not due to contamination through adsorption from the atmosphere but due to migration of low molar mass PDMS species to the surface. Scanning electron microscopy also showed the presence of surface cracks in heavily oxidised specimens."

 	abstract = {The chicken avidin gene belongs to an extended gene family encoding seven avidin-related genes ({\it AVR}s), of which only avidin is expressed in the chicken. The sequences of AVR4 and AVR5 are identical and the common protein (AVR4) has been expressed both in insect and bacterial systems. The recombinant proteins are similarly hyperthermostable and bind biotin with similarly high affinities. AVR4 was crystallized in the apo and biotin-complexed forms and their structures were determined at high resolution. Its tertiary and quaternary structures are very similar to those of avidin and streptavidin. Its biotin-binding site shows only a few alterations compared with those of avidin and streptavidin, which account for the observed differences in binding affinities. The increased hyperthermostability can be attributed to the conformation of the critical L3,4 loop and the extensive network of 1{--}3 inter-monomeric interactions. The loop contains a tandem Pro-Gly sequence and an Asp-Arg ion pair that collectively induce rigidity, thus maintaining its closed and ordered conformation in both the apo and biotin-complexed forms. In addition, Tyr115 is present on the AVR4 1{--}3 monomer{--}monomer interface, which is absent in avidin and streptavidin. The interface tyrosine generates inter-monomeric interactions, {\it i.e.} a tyrosine{--}tyrosine {$\pi$}{--}{$\pi$} interaction and a hydrogen bond with Lys92. The resultant network of interactions confers a larger 1{--}3 dimer{--}dimer contact surface on AVR4, which correlates nicely with its higher thermostability compared with avidin and streptavidin. Several of the proposed thermostability-determining factors were found to play a role in strengthening the tertiary and quaternary integrity of AVR4.},

 	abstract = {Macromolecules tend to respond to applied forces in many different ways. Chemistry at high shear forces can be intriguing, with relatively soft bonds becoming very stiff in specific force-loading geometries. Largely used in bionanotechnology, an important case is the streptavidin (SA)/biotin interaction. Although SA{\textquoteright}s four subunits have the same affinity, we find that the forces required to break the SA/biotin bond depend strongly on the attachment geometry. With AFM-based single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS), we measured unbinding forces of biotin from different SA subunits to range from 100 to more than 400 pN. Using a wide-sampling approach, we carried out hundreds of all-atom steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations for the entire system, including molecular linkers. Our strategy revealed the molecular mechanism that causes a fourfold difference in mechanical stability: Certain force-loading geometries induce conformational changes in SA{\textquoteright}s binding pocket lowering the energy barrier, which biotin has to overcome to escape the pocket.},

   	abstract = {Selectin-ligand interactions mediate the tethering and rolling of circulating leukocytes on vascular surfaces during inflammation and immune surveillance. To support rolling, these interactions are thought to have rapid off-rates that increase slowly as wall shear stress increases. However, the increase of off-rate with force, an intuitive characteristic named slip bonds, is at odds with a shear threshold requirement for selectin-mediated cell rolling. As shear drops below the threshold, fewer cells roll and those that do roll less stably and with higher velocity. We recently demonstrated a low force regime where the off-rate of P-selectin interacting with P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) decreased with increasing force. This counter-intuitive characteristic, named catch bonds, might partially explain the shear threshold phenomenon. Because L-selectin-mediated cell rolling exhibits a much more pronounced shear threshold, we used atomic force microscopy and flow chamber experiments to determine off-rates of L-selectin interacting with their physiological ligands and with an antibody. Catch bonds were observed at low forces for L-selectin-PSGL-1 interactions coinciding with the shear threshold range, whereas slip bonds were observed at higher forces. These catch-slip transitional bonds were also observed for L-selectin interacting with endoglycan, a newly identified PSGL-1-like ligand. By contrast, only slip bonds were observed for L-selectin-antibody interactions. These findings suggest that catch bonds contribute to the shear threshold for rolling and are a common characteristic of selectin-ligand interactions.}
