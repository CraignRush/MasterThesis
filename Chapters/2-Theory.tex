\chapter{Theoretical Prequisites}
The main measurement principle by a \gls{gmr}-Sensor has been already described and characterized exhaustively by \citet{lit:thes:helou}, \citet{lit:thes:reisbeck} and \citet{lit:thes:brenner}. Therefore, this theoretical part will focus on (bio-)physical aspects of a cell rolling motion inside a microfluidic channel and surface modification chemistry.

\section{Microfluidics}
The main experiments of this work were carried out in microfluidic environments, which exhibit favorable properties compared to common turbulent systems. From a fluid-mechanical standpoint, shrinking the scales makes interfacial as well as electrokinetic phenomena much more significant, and reduces the importance of pressure and gravity.\cite{lit:fluidic:kirby} However, electodynamics, chemistry and fluid dynamics are incetricably intertwined, so that fluid flow can create electric fields (and vice versa), with a degree of coupling driven by the surface chemistry. Many of the resulting phenomena arise or can explained by Cauchy-Momentum equation (eq. \ref{eq:cauchymomentum}) an the resulting Navier-Stokes equation (eq. \ref{eq:navierstokes}).

\begin{align}
	\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} &= 0 \\
		\rho \frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + \rho\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u} &= \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\tau} + \sum_{i}\mathbf{f}_i \label{eq:cauchymomentum} \\	
	\rho \frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + \rho\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u} &= -\nabla p + \eta \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} + \sum_{i}\mathbf{f}_i \label{eq:navierstokes}
\end{align}

\subsection{Flow Field inside Microchannels}
The foremost characteristic of a microchannel is the laminar flow behavior, which causes deterministic pathlines, and is described by the reynolds number. 
\begin{equation}
	\mathit{Re}\ =\ \frac{2 \rho |\overline{u}| l }{\eta}
\end{equation}
