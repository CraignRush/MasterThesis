\chapter{Theoretical Prequisites}
The main measurement principle by a \gls{gmr}-Sensor has been already described and characterized exhaustively by \citet{lit:thes:helou}, \citet{lit:thes:reisbeck} and \citet{lit:thes:brenner}. Therefore, this theoretical part will focus on (bio-)physical aspects of a cell rolling motion inside a microfluidic channel and surface modification chemistry.

\section{Microfluidics}
The main experiments of this work were carried out in microfluidic environments, which exhibit favorable properties compared to common turbulent systems. From a fluid-mechanical standpoint, shrinking the scales makes interfacial as well as electrokinetic phenomena much more significant, and reduces the importance of pressure and gravity.\cite{lit:fluidic:kirby} However, electodynamics, chemistry and fluid dynamics are incetricably intertwined, so that fluid flow can create electric fields (and vice versa), with a degree of coupling driven by the surface chemistry. Many of the resulting phenomena arise or can explained by Cauchy-Momentum equation (eq. \ref{eq:cauchymomentum}) and the resulting Navier-Stokes equation for incompressible fluids (eq. \ref{eq:navierstokes}).

\begin{align}
	\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \iiint \rho \mathrm{dV} &= - \iint \rho \mathbf{u} \cdot \vv{\mathbf{n}} \mathrm{dA} \\
	\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} &= 0 \\
		\rho \frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + \rho\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u} &= \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\tau} + \sum_{i}\mathbf{f}_i \label{eq:cauchymomentum} \\	
	\aunderbrace{\vphantom{\sum_{i}} \rho \frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t}}_{\mathrm{Transient}} + \aunderbrace{\vphantom{\sum_{i}}\rho\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u}}_{\mathrm{Convection}} &= \aunderbrace{\vphantom{\sum_{i}}-\nabla p}_{\mathrm{Pressure}} + \aunderbrace{\vphantom{\sum_{i}}\eta \nabla^2 \mathbf{u}}_{\mathrm{Viscous}} + \aunderbrace{\sum_{i}\mathbf{f}_i}_{\mathrm{Body \ Forces}} \label{eq:navierstokes}

\subsection{Flow Field inside Microchannels}
The foremost characteristic of a microchannel is the laminar flow behavior, which causes deterministic pathlines. Mathematically this is described by the reynolds number, which compares the intertia to shear forces. If it results below a certain threshold of 2000, laminar flow can be assumed. This holds true for the utilized microfluidic with the dimensions \SI{12000}{\micro\meter} x \SI{700}{\micro\meter} x \SI{150}{\micro\meter} (l x w x h) and aequous buffer solutions, where the channel width was used as characteristic length $l$. Hence, the Navier-Stokes equation can be applied to our system. 
\begin{equation}
	\mathit{Re}\ =\ \frac{2 \rho |\overline{u}| l }{\eta}
\end{equation}
The step from the Cauchy momentum equation to the Navier-Stokes equation is complex and harbors several sources of error. First, an incompressible newtonian fluid as well as channel is assumed. The used water suspensions can be approximated with negligible compressibility, which is not true for the real case. Also, for blood or other shear-thinning fluids some deviations are prone for high errors. This happens due to the fact that the \acrfull{tau} is decomposed into pressure and viscous contributions as shown in the equations \ref{eq:surfaceStressTensor}. Then, the divergence relation  of the respective viscous stress (eq. \ref{eq:divergence_Stresstensor}) does not hold for non-uniform viscosity $\eta$.
\begin{align}
	\boldsymbol{\tau} &= \boldsymbol{\tau}_{viscous} +  \boldsymbol{\tau}_{pressure} = 2\eta\epsilon - p \mathbf{I}_{\scaleto{3 \times 3}{4pt}} \label{eq:surfaceStressTensor}\\
	\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\tau}_{viscous} &= \nabla \cdot 2\eta\epsilon = \nabla \cdot \eta \nabla \mathbf{u} \ \underset{uniform}{\overset{only \ if \ \eta}{=}} \ \eta \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} 	\label{eq:divergence_Stresstensor}
\end{align}
Second, the channel height varies in reality as a result of fabrication inaccuracies. In the model case of a flow through a rectangular channel, no analytical solution of the Navier-Stokes equation exists, but a Fourier Series expansion if channel width is larger than channel height. \cite{lit:fluidic:bruus} The equation \ref{eq:flowVelocityRect} shows that height deviations can have prominent influence on a channel velocity simulation as it is proportional to $h^2$. Further, the flow rate (which is the velocity integral over the channel cross section) depends even on $h^3$. 
\begin{align}
 u   _x(y,z) = \frac{4 h^2 \Delta p}{\pi^3 \eta l} \sum_{n,odd}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^3} \left( 1- \frac{\cosh (n \pi \frac{y}{h})}{\cosh (n \pi \frac{w}{2h})} \right) \sin (n \pi \frac{z}{h}) \label{eq:flowVelocityRect}
\end{align}
Third, the transient term (eq. \ref{eq:navierstokes}) was neglected in all simulations, but a connected syringe pump possesses a slow rise time (Fig. \ref{fig:fluidic:pumpStability:transient}) and a remaining ``pulsation error'' in steady state (Fig. \ref{fig:fluidic:pumpStability:steadystate}). In effect, another error adds to the simulation, which is only valid after several ten seconds of the last flow rate change.

\section{Surface Chemistry}
Molecules can be immobilized through various mechanisms on surfaces to achieve a biological or chemical functionality. The most simple is physisorption. Here, a biomolecule is bonded only by weak elektrostatic, van-der-Waals or dipole-dipole interaction with a adsorption enthalpy below \SI{50}{\kilo\joule\per\mole}. In contrast, this yields fast reaction rates, because no activation energy has to be overcome. Although a large number of molecules can be captured with this method, several drawbacks have been identified. \cite{lit:bio:ImmobilizationTechniques, lit:bio:immobilization:UV-ABs}
For example, immobilized receptors can start to desorb or change their position, which in turn reduces sensitivity or causes false-positive results. \cite{lit:bio:physisorp:desorption, lit:chem:surfModOptics} \\
Therfore, most functionalization approaches rely on chemisorption where molecules are covalent bound to a surface. Due to the higher activation energy barrier this bonding mechanism works slower in comparison to physisorption though higher temperatures or catalysators can promote an equilibrium. One of the most well-known strategies to bring reproducible thin films on surfaces is the formation of \glspl{sam} where a dense layer of single molecules with high internal order forms upon dipping into a surface-active substance. \cite{lit:chem:sin:langeDiss}

\subsection{Silane Chemistry}

	\includegraphics{Ressources/Chemistry/Trialkoxysilan}

	\label{fig:chem:trialkoxysilane}
\end{wrapfigure} 
By the use of silane chemistry a surface is rendered organofunctional with alkoxysilane molecules. Since glass, silicon, alumina, titania, and quartz surfaces, as well as other metal oxide interfaces, are rich in hydroxyl groups, silanes are particularly useful for modifying these materials. \cite{lit:chem:silanizingGlass}\\The general formula for a silane coupling agent (Fig. \ref{fig:chem:trialkoxysilane}) typically
shows the two classes of functionality. X is a hydrolyzable
group typically alkoxy, acyloxy, halogen or amine.\\
Following hydrolysis, a reactive \gls{silanol} group is formed, which can condense with other silanol groups to form \gls{siloxane} linkages. (Fig. \ref{fig:chem:APTES}) Stable condensation products are also formed with
other oxides such as those of aluminum, zirconium, tin,
titanium, and nickel. Less stable bonds are formed with
oxides of boron, iron, and carbon, whereas alkali metal oxides and
carbonates do not form stable bonds with \acrlongpl{siloxane} at all. The R group (Fig. \ref{fig:chem:trialkoxysilane}) is a nonhydrolyzable organic radical that may posses
a functionality that imparts desired characteristics. One of the more common silanes is \gls{aptes}, where the X group consists of an \acrfull{ethoxy} group, the organic rest R is substituted by an \acrfull{amine} and the 3 \acrfull{methylene} groups alter \textit{n} to 3. \cite{lit:chem:GELEST} 
The final result of reacting an organosilane with a substrate ranges from altering the wetting or adhesion characteristics of the substrate, utilizing the substrate to catalyze chemical transformation at the heterogeneous interface, ordering the interfacial region, and modifying its partition characteristics. Significantly, it includes the ability to effect a covalent bond between organic and inorganic materials. Especially in optical or biological sensors, silane modifications open a broad range of applications. 

However, the silanization reactions bear a few drawbacks which are often neglected. For instance, silane chemistry is strongly temperature and pH-dependent. \cite{lit:chem:silaizationTemp,lit:chem:silanizationParameters} Further, in a process to build \glspl{sam} out of \gls{aptes}, the reaction has to be catalyzed by water. But already small changes in the water content cause dramatic deviations in layer thickness. \cite{lit:chem:sin:selectivemod} Additionally, silanes can crosslink to themselves through possible side reactions. (Fig. \ref{fig:chem:APTES} D) \cite{lit:chem:aptes:Crosslink}

	\label{fig:chem:APTES}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Surface Oxidation Methods}
To modify a surface with silanes, oxidized sites (\gls{hydroxyl} resp. \gls{silanol} groups) have to be present. In order to increase the presence of those reactive groups on differing substrates, various activation methods such as  \gls{piranha} or \gls{o2} - plasma treatment or an \gls{hf} dip can be chosen. \cite{lit:chem:sin:etchingandchemical}

\subsubsection{Piranha Solution}

The effectiveness of the piranha solution in removing organic residues and creating \gls{hydroxyl} groups is induced by two distinct processes. In the first process, which is notably faster, hydrogen and oxygen are removed as units of water by the concentrated \gls{h2so4}.  (Reaction \ref{rct:pir1}) This occurs due to the thermodynamically very favorable reaction with an enthalpy of \SI{-880}{\kilo\joule\per\mole} and produces \gls{h2so5}, one of the strongest oxidants known.  \cite{lit:chem:piranha}

\begin{align}
	\ce{H2SO4 + H2O2 &-> H2SO5 + H2O} \label{rct:pir1}\\
	\ce{H2SO4 + H2O2 &-> HSO4- + H3O+ + O} \label{rct:pir2}
\end{align}

In another process the sulfuric acid boosts hydrogen peroxide from a mild oxidizer into the more aggressive oxygen radical by the dehydration of \gls{h2o2}. (Reaction \ref{rct:pir1})  These two dehydration processes in the mixture result on the one hand in a highly corrosive nature against organic materials, particularly against the difficult to remove carbon. On the other hand, it is strongly acidic and oxidizing which in turn requires great care and substantial safety measures to prepare and use it harmlessly.


\subsubsection{Oxygen Plasma}
Apart from wet chemistry methods, the exposure of a surface to oxygen plasma yields \gls{hydroxyl} groups as well. In a plasma chamber, a low pressure gas is irradiated by \si{\kilo\hertz} to \si{\mega\hertz} radiation to excite and ionize its atoms. The energy of the generated particles therefore is
