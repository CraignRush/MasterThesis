\section{Microfluidic Fabrication}

\subsection{Development of Layout}

\subsection{Patterning of Photoresist}

\subsection{Soft Lithography}
The fabricated wafer was placed the center of a \SI{90}{\centi\meter} petri dish. A \gls{abbr:pdms} mold was created by vigorous mixing of the pre-polymer base with its curing agent (Sygard 184, Dowsil) in a ratio of 10:1 (w/w). For \SI{3}{\inch} wafers, thin channels were casted from \SI{15}{\gram}, normal channels from \SI{20}{\gram} PDMS in the petri dish. Gas bubbles were removed from the mixture in a desiccator for \SI{20}{\minute} at \SI{2}{\hecto\pascal} , and the clear \gls{abbr:pdms} was cured in an oven (Um, Memmert) for \SI{1}{\hour} at \SI{60}{\degreeCelsius}. After curing, the \gls{abbr:pdms} mold was released from the petri dish carefully, taken off the wafer and stored in a clean petri dish upon further processing.

\subsection{Bonding of Microfluidic}
Under laminar flow, crosslinked molds were cut into pieces with the respecting single \gls{abbr:uf} with a razor blade. Holes for in- and outlet were punched through the containing channels with a biopsy puncher (ID \SI{0.5}{\milli\meter}, WellTech). The substrates and \glspl{abbr:uf} were sonicated in acetone and \gls{abbr:dih2o} for \SI{5}{\minute} and dried with filtered \gls{abbr:n2} completely. For the bonding of PDMS to various substrates different protocols have been established:

\subsubsection{PDMS Glueing}
Here, a micron-height layer of uncured \gls{abbr:pdms} was used as an adhesive layer between \gls{abbr:uf} and substrate. Approx. \SI{3}{\milli\liter} were poured onto a \SI{3}{\inch} wafer and spun down for \SI{5}{\minute} at \SI{6000}{\per\minute}. The microchannel was placed on the substrate by visual control of a stereo microscope (SMZ800, Nikon) with 8-fold magnification. Subsequently, the bonding process could be finished by a \SI{1}{\hour} bake at \SI{60}{\degreeCelsius} or over-night at room temperature.
\subsubsection{Plasma Bonding}
Due to the chemical nature of glass (or more generally oxides) and \gls{abbr:pdms}, the respective parts can be activated by the exposure to a controlled oxygen plasma which generates additional silanol (Si-OH) groups on their surfaces and removes impurities at the same time. Bringing the activated surfaces in contact triggers the formation of covalent bonds almost immediately. First, the acetone-wiped substrates and the microchannels were centered inside the plasma cleaner (Zepto, Diener). Second, vacuum was applied to a final pressure <\SI{0.2}{\hecto\pascal}. Third, the chamber was flushed with pure \gls{abbr:o2} until a chamber pressure from \SIrange{0.7}{0.8}{\hecto\pascal} had been stabilized. Fourth, the plasma process was executed with \SI{30}{\watt} (Power-Poti: 100) for \SIrange{45}{60}{\second} (Time-Poti: 15-20). Upon finish, the chamber was flushed for \SI{5}{\second} and ventilated. Immediately, the corresponding workpieces were brought into contact and pressed together gently. To ensure a durable bond, the assembled workpieces were baked for \SI{1}{\hour} at \SI{60}{\degreeCelsius}.

\subsubsection{Reversible Bonding}
To bond the \gls{abbr:uf} to a substrate reversibly and without residues, the channel can be brought into contact with the bottom part without any adhesinon agent. For low-pressure as well as vacuum driven flows, this method is preferrable due to its time and work efficiency.

\section{Surface Bio-Functionalization}

\subsection{Surface Activation}
To functionalize any silicon containing surface with \ch{Si-OH} groups which the utilized silane could interact with, multiple surface activation pathways were explored. First, substrates were cleaned in \gls{abbr:hcl}:\gls{abbr:meoh} and \gls{abbr:h2so4} before they were immersed in boiling water. Second, surface silanol groups were achieved by \gls{abbr:piranha} immersion and third by a \gls{abbr:hf} dip.\\
For all methods, the following reagents were used: \gls{abbr:dih2o} (\SI{0,054}{\micro\siemens}, Merck MilliQ)), acetone (\SI{>99,9}{\percent}, VWR), \gls{abbr:etoh} (absolute, VWR), \gls{abbr:meoh} (\SI{99.8}{\percent}, VWR), \gls{abbr:acoh} (glacial, VWR), \gls{abbr:hcl} (\SI{37}{\percent}, Sigma-Aldrich), \gls{abbr:h2so4} (\SIrange{95}{98}{\percent}, VWR), \gls{abbr:h2o2} (\SI{30}{\percent} (w/w), Sigma-Aldrich), \gls{abbr:hf} (\SI{5}{\percent}, VWR)

\subsubsection{Work Safety Remarks}
Before the work with one of the acid solutions was carried out, serveral safety measures were implemented. As any diluted acid solution becomes very hot immediately due to the exothermic reaction, every container should be placed inside a cooled water or ice bath. Additionally, the beaker as well as concentrated acid flasks should be gripped firmly by a laboratory stand to avoid a tip over. As the reactivity of chemicals is highly temperature-dependent, the solutions was processed further when they had been cooled to \SI{<=70}{\degreeCelsius}. It should be also noted that - as in every chemical reaction, but especially ones with \gls{abbr:h2so4} - the acid was always poured into the other reactant to avoid splashing and boiling.

\subsubsection{Hydrochloric-Sulfuric Acid Activation}
To degrease any glass or \gls{abbr:sin} surface, a protocol according to \citet{lit:chem:Dressick} was used. There, the surfaces were first sonicated in acetone and \gls{abbr:dih2o}  for \SI{5}{\minute}. Afterwards these were immersed in a 1:1 (v/v) solution of \gls{abbr:hcl}:\gls{abbr:meoh} for \SI{>30}{\minute}, rinsed with \gls{abbr:dih2o} copiously and soaked in \gls{abbr:h2so4} for \SI{>30}{\minute} as well. Then, the samples were rinsed again in \acrlong{abbr:dih2o}. To form silanol groups on the activated surface, the surfaces were finally immersed in \SI{>90}{\degreeCelsius} heated (SuperNuova+, Thermo Scientific) \gls{abbr:dih2o}  for at least \SI{2}{\hour}.
\subsubsection{Piranha Activation}
In this method, activation was carried out in a 1:5 (v/v) \acrfull{abbr:piranha} solution at \SI{70}{\degreeCelsius} for \SI{30}{\minute}. After treatment, the samples were rinsed carefully with \gls{abbr:dih2o} three times.
\subsubsection{Hydrofluoric Acid Activation}

\subsection{Chemical Surface Functionalization}
Chemically activated surfaces were now coupled with \gls{abbr:aptes} covalently. Therefore an aqueous silane solution was prepared from \gls{abbr:etoh} with volume fractions of \SI{5}{\percent} \gls{abbr:dih2o}, \SI{0.5}{\percent} aqueous \gls{abbr:acoh} (pH 4.5) and \SI{1}{\percent} \gls{abbr:aptes} in this order. The samples were soaked immediately after their activation in the silane solution. The reaction was carried out for \SIrange{2}{4}{\hour} at \SI{>40}{\degreeCelsius}. At finish, all specimens were rinsed three times or sonicated for \SI{5}{\minute} in absolute \gls{abbr:etoh}.\\
Then, the amine terminated surface modification was enhanced by a carbodiimide conjugation with \gls{abbr:paa}. As above, a reaction consisting of \SI{0.5}{\molar} \gls{abbr:mes} buffer with \SI{1}{\milli\gram\per\milli\liter}, \SI{6}{\milli\molar} \gls{abbr:edc} and  \SI{3}{\milli\molar} \gls{abbr:nhs} was activated for \SI{15}{\minute} on a magnetic stirrer. Subsequently, the prepared samples were immersed in the solution for \SI{1}{\hour} on a rotation shaker (VWR). As final cleaning, the slides were rinsed or sonicated for \SI{5}{\minute} in \gls{abbr:dih2o} and stored in fresh \gls{abbr:dih2o} at \SI{4}{\degreeCelsius} up to \SI{14}{\day} upon further use.\cite{lib:chem:Anti-EpCAM-PAA}
